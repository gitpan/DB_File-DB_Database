			DB_File::DB_Database 0.031
		------------------------------------

This is the README file for the DB_File::DB_Database packages. Please read it 
if you install this module for the first time or if there are
some problems with the module.

This module can handle DB_File database(DB_HASH, key/value pairs) as a table. 
It also can create index files(DB_BTREE) to faster the searching speed. It is 
an Beta version, use it at your own risk.

Installation:
        Perl 5.004 is required.	DB_File is required.
        To verify the DB_File is installed and work well first is better.
        
	Download the tar.gz, unpack it, change to the DB_File::DB_Database
	directory. Then do

		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install

	instead of just perl Makefile.PL, and in your scripts do
				   
		use lib '/your/directory';
		use DB_File::DB_Database;

	You are free to just copy the 'lib' directory where you want it to
	have. This should work.

Problems and bug reports:
	run the flowering to test the package.

	t/1_open_close.t
	t/2_read_write.t
	
	If you found any bugs or make any patches, I would be appriciate 
	to hear from you.

If it works for you:
	I'd appreciate any message if you use the module and find it
	usefull -- I'm just curious what tasks people use the module
	for and what they expect from it. You can of course also
	send something more valuable.
